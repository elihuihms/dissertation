./block_487157.pdb
The bmrb deposited coordinates (who added the Fme residues??? - they don't appear in any of Craig's tructures)

./block_487157_e.pdb
An edited version of the BMRB coordinates, in which I've turned the formylmethionine N-term residue back into a regular MET

input.pdb
A set of coordinates I found in /omega1/craig/Bsubtilis/cns/trimer/anneal/092806/nhrdc/3.5/input.pdb
