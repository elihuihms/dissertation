This directory contains experimental data, structure generation, and analysis scripts for the ESCRT-I complex used to validate MESMER

./ESCRT1.pdb: The ESCRT-I complex assembled by the author, and used throughout.

./ESCRT1.target: The MESMER target for global fitting

./exp_data: Experimental DEER and SAXS data provided by the Hummer lab

./restraint_analysis: Scripts used to analyze the structural characteristics of candidate structures, as well as those selected by MESMER using different combinations of experimental restraints

./scripts: Shell scripts used to automate several processes, including the superposition of DEER labels

./structure_gen: Scripts and coordinate files for unrestrained and restrained sampling of the ESCRT-I complex using Xplor-NIH, as well as the generation of DEER label superpositions
