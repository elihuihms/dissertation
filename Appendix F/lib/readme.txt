This directory contains several essential Python libraries that were used to either validate MESMER or directly used by MESMER itself:

./PDB_DEER_sim: Scripts and libraries used to calculate double electron-electron resonance curves from PDB coordinate files

./PDB_FRET_sim: Scripts and libraries used to calculate fluorescence lifetime curves from PDB coordinate files

./pyParaTools_modified: A slightly customized version of the pyParaTools library from Thomas Huberâ€™s lab, originally from github.com/mscook/pyParaTools
