This directory contains the source code for MESMER v.0.9.0, and the essential input files and analysis scripts for validation against the ESCRT-I, calmodulin, and TRAP-AT systems.

./calmodulin: Calmodulin structure generation and initial paramagnetic tensor analysis

./escrt: ESCRT-I structure generation, label rotamer superposition, DEER data calculation

./lib: Several essential Python libraries that were used to either validate MESMER or directly used by MESMER itself:

./mesmer: Source code and plugins for the most recent MESMER version

./trap: TRAP-AT connectivity files (see Appendix B for actual structure gen code)

./utilities: Useful structure analysis scripts
