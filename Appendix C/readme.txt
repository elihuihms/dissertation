This directory contains analysis scripts and model definitions for AT-TRAP heteropolymerization.

./BNGL_models: Contains the different models of cooperativity used to simulate AT-TRAP association, written in the BioNetGen language

./DYNAFIT_models: Contains several different models used to fit uAT+TRAP binding, written in DYNAFIT

./exp_fit: Contains several iterations of the exponential phase fitter, written in Python

./FRET_models: Contains the structures and scripts for calculating the average FRET efficiency between TRAP-TRAP and TRAP-AT.

./ODE_models: Contains a home-built ordinary differential equation fitter, written in Python, and a validation DYNAFIT model
