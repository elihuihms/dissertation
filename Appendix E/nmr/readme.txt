./coordinates
Starting AT trimer PDBs from the BMRB

./examples
Some examples from the Xplor-NIH folks demonstrating annealing and refinement from SAXS data

./gen_psf
Directory containing Xplor-NIH script to make the necessary connectivity. Note that explicit RDC anisotropy atom coordinates are no longer needed!

./restraints
Cleaned up BMRB constraints and SAXS data
